A dungeon crawler game that I developed for 7dlr (http://7drl.org/). I used curses (pdcurses actually) which was a lot of fun!

Unlike other crawlers, you don't control the adventurer but the dungeon itself. You can throwsummon creatures (only goblins actually) or control individual creatures and you win when adventurer dies.

There are skills, eqipments, leveling, consumables in the game. Adventurer can loot enemies, use consumables and spells when necessary. I tried to write some basic AI which decides what to do for adventurer in each turn (and for your goblins). They try to use healing skills while being at low, try to cover near walls so they can't surround adventurer all around etc...

Well, that is pretty much all, I don't think I will be able to continue working on this.
